# Nexum

**Nexum** is a modern, minimal, and security-focused social media platform designed to connect people through calm, content-first interactions.

It is **inspired by** existing social platforms, but **not a clone** of Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.  
Nexum focuses on **clean UI, intentional UX, and scalable architecture**.

## ✨ Vision

> Build a next-generation social platform that feels calm, premium, and human —  
> where content is the focus, not noise.
